GIT PULL USING SSH



https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/


A. Checking for existing SSH keys

ls -al ~/.ssh

By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

id_dsa.pub
id_rsa.pub


B. Create New SSH Key

1. Open Terminal.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "chintan.d@simform.in"

2. This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.


Generating public/private rsa key pair.
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.


Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [project_name recommanded] [Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".


Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]


C. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent


1. Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 59566


2. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you used an existing SSH key rather than generating a new SSH key, you'll need to replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your existing private key file.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa



D. Add Pulbic (.pub) Key to BitBucker Deployment Key or Git Hub


https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
	
E. Copy Public Key from .pub

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

F. For exisitng cloned project replace your account with simformteam account, you could find this link from respactive repository

git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket.org:simformteam/halal-backend.git



This is the public key for reg@simform.inssh-rsa

Add private key permanently with ssh-add on Ubuntu
A solution would be to force the key files to be kept permanently, by adding them in your ~/.ssh/config file:

IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitHubKey
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_buhlServer

http://stackoverflow.com/a/4246809/1578380

Sometimes you may get error like
fatal: failed to write object
error: unpack-objects exited with error code 128
error: unpack failed: unpack-objects abnormal exit

just run following sequence of commands

ssh me@myserver
cd repository/.git

sudo chmod -R g+ws *
sudo chgrp -R mygroup *

git config core.sharedRepository true

Sometimes ssh-add is not having ssh key identity in process list
     Like 
 ssh-add -l
 
The agent has no identities.
 
Solution 
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/simform_solutions
 
Identity added: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/simform_solutions (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/simform_solutions)
 
Check
ssh-add -l
 
4096 c1:d7:05:86:b0:b0:b3:26:c9:d2:c1:84:2a:af:8f:51 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/simform_solutions (RSA)
